#Minesweeper Bot Project

#Description
This project involves building and training a Minesweeper bot using neural networks. The bot aims to play Minesweeper efficiently, making decisions based on the game state.

#Features
Traditional Minesweeper Boards: Bot plays on standard Minesweeper boards of varying difficulties (Easy, Intermediate, Expert).
Variable Numbers of Mines: Bot adapts to different numbers of mines on a 30x30 board.
Variable Size Boards: Bot handles Minesweeper boards of any size from 5x5 to 50x50.

#Tasks
Traditional Minesweeper Boards: Develop a neural network-based bot to play Minesweeper on standard difficulty levels.
Variable Numbers of Mines: Train the bot to perform well with varying numbers of mines on a fixed-size board.
Variable Size Boards: Design a network capable of playing on boards of different sizes.
